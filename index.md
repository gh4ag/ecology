# AG's blog on ecology 

### A personal walk down the ecology lane
### Ecology = Humans + Earth

## Why this blog?

I wanted to start a blog on ecology, to share my thoughts on a topic that, as I beleive, will be the center of our societies. Ecology applied to Humanity is, in a nutshell, the science of how human civilizations interact with their environements, and thus any ecosystem. Consequently, it also deals with the extraction and use of raw materials. Culture, economics, politcs, psychology, biology, physics and usages of technology are tools to study different aspects of the same topic, that I will therefore refer to, here, as Ecology.

I am begging you for your benevolence, and I hope you will find in my wrttings, beyond the mistakes that I could make, some elements that will help you shape your thoughts on one of the most important, if not the only one, topics of the next centuries.
