### Motivation to talk about Economics

Ecology, being a human based problem, can not be considered without studying how societies live and develop. Economics is the science of trade between humans, and thus, is at the core of the lives and development of societies. It is however not the science of all human exchanges. Cultural, spirtual social and emotional exchanges also are part of interactions between Humans. 

Economics, is about how to exchange work, even power, between people. It is also a human abstraction on the physical world, as it gives a (semantic) sens of worth to things that nature "gives" for free. It happens, also, that the quantitative worth humans give to commodities doesn't correspond at all to their physical reality. Indeed, money doesn't have an equivocal correspondance to the amount of energy a commodity represents. Money doesn't always well represent the energy it took to produce goods or of the energy we can get from it. For instance, the energy content of 1 L of fuel is much higher than that of a day worth of work of a human being (think 1 L of petrol = work of 2 healthy adults over a day), yet, ask any CEO, petrole is cheaper than human labour.

Mechanically it also deals with how societes are layered, since at its root there is the concept of added value. Layers stack their added value along the supply chain, between the origin of the product, Nature, and its end clients, us. Even, when we just sell a service or make a contract, there is often a piece of matter, a computer screen some electrical energy, a piece of black board, a paper sheet, that is used to transmit data --- services are not immaterial even in the digital era.

Economies, through their evolution, through often offered more liberty to individuals within their communities, yet, the counterpart is the enslavement to its sytem, that relies today on money. For instance, instead of being the servant for life of some noble family, a family in control of the territory where this one would have grown, it is possible to sell one's trade and skill to the highest bidder. Under this aspect, liberalism and economic growth, for instance, gave to minorities within their communities the possibility to gain recognition and power, since they were not just enslaved to their hierarchical position, but could get some means to self-development and self-empowerement through hard work. One example, is the progressive apparition of women in the economic life, after the industrial revolutions, which gave them, throughout many continuous struggles, the possibility to reach the highest leadership positions in Human societies --- and struggles are probably never going to be over as it is a competition for power.

Therefore, one can only look at the ecologic full picture if one is has some basic notions of economics.
